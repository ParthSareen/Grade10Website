<h1 class="Headers">    Intergrated circuits    </h1>
	<p class="parathree">The third generation of computers is the intergrated circuits. This is where the computers <span>really</span> started to become faster, efficient and more usable. Transistors were placed on silicon chips which are now called semi-conducters. The input and and output also changed. Keyboards were being used as input and monitors were being used as output. These computing systems had an actual operating system from which the keyboard and monitor interface with.</p>

	<p class="parathree">These computers can use multiple applications at once and has a central programs which would monitor the memory of the computer. These computers have became more accesible to the public due to the size and the price of the computer. </p>
