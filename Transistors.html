	<p class="paratwo"> Transistors were invented in 1947. They made computers faster, smaller and cheaper, more energy effecient, and also more reliable.</p>

	<p class="paratwo">However, it still produced a lot of heat that could possibly cause the computer to be damaged. Punch cards were still being used as input and the output was also printed paper like the first generation of computers. The computers also started to use a magnetic core instead of a magnetic drum to store memory. Higher level languages were being programmed and programers can type words instead of using binary.</p>
