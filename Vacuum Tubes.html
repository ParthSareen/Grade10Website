    <p class="paraone"> The first generation of computers is 'Vacuum Tubes'. They were used as circuitry for computers. During this time, magnetic drums were used to store memory. It was very slow and expensive. Punched cards and paper tape were used as input. The ouput came
  as printed sheets of paper. Solving problems took a really long time. <img src="http://pkirs.utep.edu/mit5312/Pictures/fsq7-50.jpg" /> <img src="http://www.ptc.dcs.edu/Moody/comphistory/edsac2.jpg" /> </p>
	<p class="paraone"> These first-generation computers relied on machine language which not a lot of people knew.</p>
