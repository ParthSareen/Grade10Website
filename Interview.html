    Parth: P </p>
<p class="parasix">Mom:     M</p>
<p class="parasix">P: Hello, I will be asking you your thoughts and opinions on computers. Lets begin!</p>
<p class="parasix">M: Alright, go ahead!</p>
<p class="parasix">P: I know that when you were my age you did not have computers in your home. How did you finish research projects?</p>
<p class="parasix">M: Whenever we had to do any kind of research, we would always consult books in the library.</p>
<p class="parasix">P: Did it take a lot of time to finish those projects?</p>
<p class="parasix">M: Haha! Yes it took a lot longer than it does now. You have information on your finger tips.</p>
<p class="parasix"> P: Being a teacher, how do you feel computers have impacted education?</p>
<p class="parasix">M: Well, computers both have pros and cons when it comes to this. One pro is that everything is faster to do, homework and projects. One con is that students can easily plagiarize other peoples' hard work.</p>
<p class="parasix">P: Thank you so much for your time! </p>
